### Hi there, thank you for visiting my profile👋

I am GrHalbgott, a Master's student at Heidelberg University in Geography and Geoinformatics. There is not much to find here yet besides some first projects and a repository about my hobby no. 1, but if you are interested in coding and music, I am happily welcoming you to a fitting growing place 😄

Currently I am working on two Python projects (index-calculator and random_walk) and trying to implement new stuff to learn more about coding, versioning and additional topics. I would say that I still am a beginner, but I definitely have coding experience and would not have to start at zero if we would collaborate.

Speaking of, I would gladly collaborate with you if you have some ideas for really anything, be it coding, music or scientific work. 
Of course you can ask me about anything, I am happy to get in touch with you! ✨

How to reach me: use the <a href="https://github.com/GrHalbgott/GrHalbgott/discussions">Discussions</a> section!
I can share further contact information after a first "hello world" from you 😁

Looking forward to hear from you!
Best, GrHalbgott
